# This is my Submission for my Postgraduate Final Year Project

Angular and Spring based website displaying data on up-to-date Covid-19 case statistics Worldwide but more explicitly regarding Irish cases by use of various graphs depicting cases relevant to age, gender, severity as well as
incorporating GIS locational data. This Angular based
front-end application was coupled with a custom
Spring MVC back-end application which harnessed
data regularly every two minutes from various
resources including World Health Organization and
HSE public datasets to be communicated to the
visually represented graphs on the front-end
application.
